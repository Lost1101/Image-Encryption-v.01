# image-encryption
Using python language to encrypt data. The algorithm that we implemented in this project is AES (Advance Encryption Standard) using CBC Mode. We Do Double Encryption of which data will be encrypted on the data so that we get a more secure type of data. We are very happy that someone will make some improvements or use the main logic of our code >.&lt;

A GUIDE TO IMAGE ENCRYPTION PROGRAMS.

NOTES:

1. File formats supported are only .png, .jpg and .jpeg image extensions.
2. Encryption, decryption and key results are saved in the specified default folder.
3. The key must be well hidden so that others cannot decipher it
4. The program can only process one image/file.enc at a time. So if you want to encode different images you have to change the source image periodically

Encryption step:

1. Press the button to search for images
2. Enter the name of the .enc file.
3. Enter the name of the key TXT file
4. If yes, click Encrypt. encrypt
5. The .enc file will be saved in the Encryption Result folder and the key will be saved in the Key folder.

Step description:

1. Find the desired .enc file and restore the original image
2. Enter a name for the decrypted result (e.g. = "hasil.jpg") and make sure the file extension is the same as the original file (e.g. if original = .jpg then decrypt The resulting extension must also be .jpg). . )
3. Enter the hidden key in key.py (Keys variable).
4. Press "Decryption!!" when done.
5. The image is saved in the "decryption result" folder

remarks:

The program is still in development, so all kinds of changes, optimizations and fixes are expected
If you have any suggestions or comments, please express them in a more modern code format.

thank you for using. Enjoy our program:
